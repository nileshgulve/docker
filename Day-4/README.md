### **Day 4: Docker-Compose**

#### **What is Docker-Compose?**
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define the services, networks, and volumes required by your application.

#### **Example: Docker Compose for a Web App with Redis**

1. **docker-compose.yml File**:

2. **Running the Compose File**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Stop and Remove Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
